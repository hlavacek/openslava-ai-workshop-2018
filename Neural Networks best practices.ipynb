    "### Get as much data as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only few examples of machine learning algorithms that require low amounts of data. If you want accuracy, if you want performance, you need as much data as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get unbiased data\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias in data is bad. Imagine that you train your neural network to recognize dogs. But because you didn't had images of poodles, your network will not learn to recognize those. Or because all your pictures have been taken in night, you won't recognize them during the day. This can happen to you all the time, and can have serious consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Never Fake Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you will always find your self between unsuficient data for your project and a manager telling you \"fake it\" or \"generate it\". There are real cases when someone got an awesome idea to generate testing data. It will never work. There is always something (at least in big data), in real world, that one can never think about. So using real data (a lot of them) will always give you proper results, while doing anything on faked (or generated) data, will only lead you to something that is useless.\n",
